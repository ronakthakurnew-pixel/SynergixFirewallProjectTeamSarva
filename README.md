❗ Problems in Today’s Cybersecurity Infrastructure

Modern organizations face multiple challenges when securing their IT infrastructure:

🔹 Fragmented Tooling

You must buy and manage many tools for complete protection:

Anti-Virus

Employee Firewalls

Server Firewalls (WAF)

Private WiFi Firewalls
…and more.

🔹 Platform Dependency

Most tools work only on:

Windows

or Linux

or macOS
Few solutions support all platforms, especially Android/iOS.

🔹 Complex Integration

Multiple installations, agents, and software updates create heavy management overhead.

🔹 Device Resource Usage

Running continuous security processes consumes:

RAM

CPU

Battery
Slowing down user systems.

🔹 Privacy Concerns

Many tools send sensitive logs/data to third-party servers.

🔹 Weak Protection for Mobile

Android and iOS devices often lack strong, enterprise-grade firewall solutions.

🔹 Poor AI Integration

Most solutions lack modern AI-driven:

Zero-day attack detection

Phishing prevention

Behavioral analysis
